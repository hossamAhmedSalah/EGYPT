            Neferneferuaten Nefertiti (c.‚Äâ 1370 ‚Äì c. 1330 BC) was a queen of the 18th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the great royal wife of Pharaoh Akhenaten. Nefertiti and her husband were known for a religious revolution, in which they worshipped one god only, Aten, or the sun disc. With her husband, she reigned at what was arguably the wealthiest period of ancient Egyptian history. Some scholars believe that Nefertiti ruled briefly as Neferneferuaten after her husband's death and before the ascension of Tutankhamun, although this identification is a matter of ongoing debate. If Nefertiti did rule as Pharaoh, her reign was marked by the fall of Amarna and relocation of the capital back to the traditional city of Thebes.

            The work of Horus for all the kings of Egypt was the ideal, as he avenged his father from his murderer and was just. Therefore, they took the name "Horus the Living", which is one of the oldest royal titles in ancient Egypt. His name was mentioned in ancient times in conjunction with Hathor and the first scorpion king. Horus appears in this title standing on the edifice of the palace, surrounding the name of the king.

            We also find Horus on the Narmer panel or the famous painting of King Mina, which is from the era of the First Dynasty in Egypt. He grabs the heads of Egypt's defeated enemies and presents them to the king. Until the fourth dynasty, the title of Pharaoh consisted only of the name of Horus, and during that family the name of the golden Horus also appeared, as a second title for the king

            The Nishan al-Kamal or the Order of Perfection is one of the decorations that were awarded during the royal era in Egypt. The Nishan was established by a royal order issued by Sultan Hussein Kamel in 1915 AD, and it was preserved during the era of the Republic in 1953 AD, and this medal is granted to women only.

                Luxor is a modern city in Upper Egypt which 
                includes the site of the Ancient Egyptian 
                city of Thebes. Luxor has frequently
                 been characterized as the "world's greatest 
                 open-air museum", as the ruins of the Egyptian
                  temple complexes at Karnak and Luxor stand 
                  within the modern city.

            <h3>Cruising the Nile</h3>
            <img src="images/nile (1).jfif" alt="nile the Egyption river">
            <img src="images/nile (2).jfif" alt="the Nile">
            <p>
                Egypt is defined by the Nile. For many visitors,
                 a multi-day cruise upon this famed waterway that 
                 saw the rise of the Pharaonic era is a highlight 
                 of their Egypt trip.

                Cruising the Nile is also the most relaxing way
                 to see the temples that stud the banks of
                  the river on the route between Luxor and Aswan, 
                  plus sunrise and sunset over the date-palm-studded 
                  river banks, backed by sand dunes, is one of Egypt's
                   most tranquil vistas.
                
                The two famous sights on a Nile Cruise are the Temple 
                of Kom Ombo and Edfu's Temple of Horus, 
                where all the big cruise boats stop.
                
                If you'd prefer a less crowded and slower experience,
                 though, and don't mind "roughing it" a bit,
                  you can also cruise the Nile by felucca (Egypt's traditional lateen-sailed wooden boats), 
                  which also allows you to create your own itinerary.
                
                The vast amount of cruise boat itineraries depart
                 from either Luxor and Aswan,
                  but feluccas can only be chartered for
                   multi-day trips from Aswan.

            <h3>Diving the Red Sea</h3>

            <p>
                Below the Red Sea's surface is 
                another world as fascinating as the 
                temples and tombs on land.

                The coral reefs of
                the Red Sea are renowned among scuba 
                divers for both the soft corals on display 
                and the vast amount of sea life,
                ranging from colorful reef fish and nudibranchs,
                to sharks, dolphins, turtles, rays, and even dugongs.

                For divers, the most famous town to base yourself in
                is Sharm el-Sheikh on the Sinai Peninsula,
                closest to the reefs of Ras Mohammed National Park, 
                as well as the reefs of the Straits of Tiran.

                To dive the sites of the Straits of Gubal head
                to Hurghada or El Gouna on the Red Sea coast,
                while advanced divers should check out 
                the resort of Marsa Alam, the nearest base for
                diving Egypt's "deep south" dive sites.

            As well as fish life and coral,
             the Red Sea is a major wreck-diving
              destination.
               The most famous wreck is the Thistlegorm,
                a British WWII cargo ship that 
                was on its way to resupply 
                Allied troops when it was bombed by 
                the Germans in 1941.

            Today the site is regarded by
             divers as one of the top five wreck dives 
             in the world due to the vast cargo of cars, 
             motorbikes, and WWII memorabilia that can be 
             seen both scattered on the sea bed around 
             the wreck and inside the ship itself.
            
            Dive boat trips to the wreck are organized
             from both Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada.

            The atmospheric, narrow lanes of the

             full of mosques, madrassas 
             (Islamic schools of learning), 
             and monuments dating from the Fatimid 
             through to the Mameluke eras.

            This is where you'll find the labyrinth
             shopping souq of Khan el-Khalili, 
             where coppersmiths and artisans 
             still have their tiny workshops, 
             and stalls are laden with ceramics, 
             textiles, spice, and perfume.
            
            Surrounding the market is a muddle of roads, 
            home to some of the most beautiful preserved 
            architecture of the old Islamic empires.
            
            There is a wealth of history here to explore.
             Visit Al-Azhar Mosque and the dazzling Sultan 
             Hassan Mosque, and make sure to climb up to 
             the roof of the ancient medieval gate of Bab
              Zuweila for the best minaret-speckled
               panoramas across the district.

            Egypt's South Sinai region, 
            on the Sinai Peninsula, 
            offers a beach for every type of traveler.

            Sharm el-Sheikh is a European-style resort 
            town packed full of luxury hotels,
             international restaurants, and bags
             
             of entertainment options.
              A favorite with Europeans on
               winter-sun vacations, 
               many of the resorts here cater
                to families on one- or two-week 
                sun-and-sand breaks.
            
            Dahab is a low-key beach town with a
             budget-traveler heart, which is just 
             as much about desert excursions and 
             adventures as the sea.
              It's particularly known 
              for its cheap dive-package 
              deals and for its lagoon beach area
               where windsurfing and 
               kitesurfing are the top activity.
            
            Up the coast, between the port town of
             Nuweiba and the border town of Taba are
              the bamboo hut retreats that offer complete
               get-away-from-it-all respites from
                life and back-to-basics beach life.
